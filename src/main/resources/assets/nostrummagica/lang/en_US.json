    "info.shrines.desc": "Shrines are an important part of Nostrum Magica. Scattered throughout throughout the world are shrines that contain a host of challenging mosters, loot, and (most importantly) aspected altars that help you unlock different spell components. Gaining mastery over more spell components is crucial to advanced in Nostrum Magica. In order to construct different spells, you'll need different shapes, triggers, and elements. Unlocking these involves visiting shrines. Finding shrines can be difficult. There are two items in Nostrum Magica that make this a little bit easier, but those are for you to find out. Element and Trigger shrines are much more common than shape shrines. There's guaranteed to be a Shrine of the Single shape near the worlds spawn location.",
    "info.spells.name": "Spells",
    "info.spells.desc": "Spells are made up of triggers and loaded shape components. Triggers contain the main logic of a spell. For example: the touch trigger specifies that the shape will affect the entity you're touching when you cast it; The health trigger sets off the spell once the target's health drops below a certain threshhold; The proximity trigger advances the spell once someone gets close enough to the spot it was placed. Loaded shape components contain the actual effects of the spell, from doing elemental damage to causing debuffs to transforming items into others. You can read more about constructing these components in the SpellCraft guide.|Spells can have multiple triggers in them, possible creating spells with multiple stages. If you have a spell that has a touch trigger followed by a delay trigger, the spell will start when cast by affecting whoever you were touching at the time. After that, any effects that directly follow the touch will be done, and then it will wait for the duration of the delay trigger. At that point the spell will proceed, performing any following effects and triggers until it ends. Constructing staged spells like this is a powerful component of Nostrum Magica, and allows you to create contingencies, delayed surprise attacks, and complex buff stacks.|The actual effect of a spell comes from the particular combination of elements and alterations on a spell shape. Any spell shape with only an element attached to it will do damage in that element. Alterations mutate the effects into others. For example, a shape with the physical element and the inflict alteration will reduce give weakness to the target. A shape with lightning and the support element will pull any nearby entities closer. You can read more about each type of spell component (triggers, element, shape, alteration) in their respective guide tabs.|Spells start with a trigger. As spells progress, they track (maybe different) entities: their target, and their auxillary target called 'other'. Sometimes these are the same thing: the self trigger targets the caster and keeps the caster as the spell's other. Other times, these differ: the touch trigger targets whoever was touched, but has the 'toucher' as the other. In most cases, the main target of the spell is probably who you are interested in affecting. In other cases, it's nice to be able to know and use the other. If you use spell debugging, you can see who the other is in each stage of the spell.",
    "info.trigger.name": "Triggers",
    "info.trigger.desc": "Triggers form the how and why of a spell. They form the stages of the spell and largely impact who is being targetted. The Self trigger instantly affects the caster. The beam trigger will cast the rest of the spell on all entities that were touched by the beam.|Unlocking triggers is the easiest of all components. To unlock them, you must simply find a shrine to the trigger and venture deep within. Once you locate the altar, you can interact with it to gain knowledge of the trigger. Be warned, though, as each shrine can only be used once. If a mage has already visited the shrine and taken the knowledge, you will be unable to unlock the trigger using that shrine and have to find another.",
    "info.shape.name": "Shapes",
    "info.shape.desc": "Shapes hold the effects of a spell. There are very few types of shapes which detail exactly who is affected by the spell. The Chain shape, for example, affects the target and some number of entities around them.|When constructing a spell, all the effects are determined by the shape runes. To add effects to a spell, you need to combine element and alteration runes with shapes runes to form filled shape runes. This is done simply by combining them in a crafting bench. Shape runes are loaded with some number of elements as well as optionally a single alteration. This combination (the number of elements and the alteration that's attached, if any) determine the actaul effect of the shape. You can have multiple shapes in a spell. Each will be performed on the target of the spell at that time. A more in-depth guide to creating filled shape runes can be found in the Spellcraft guide.|Shape shrines are much rarer than trigger and element shrines. The Single shape is easy to acquire: You simply interact with the altar in the shrine to get it. How to unlock the others, however, is a mystery...",
    "info.element.name": "Elements",
    "info.element.desc": "Nostrum Magica has seven elements: Fire, Ice, Wind, Earth, Lightning, Ender, and Physical. Each element results in different effects when combined with an alteration in a spell.|Elements are added to shape runes to form the effects of the spell. Elements can be added together to increase the effectiveness up to a maximum of tier 3. Combining two level 1 elemental runes together results in a level 2 elemental rune. To get a level three, you'll need the equivalent of 4 level 1 runes.|As part of unlocking magic, you automatically gain first level mastery over the Physical element. In order to master the other elements, you must form mastery orbs and offere them to shrines of those elements. After doing so, you will begin the challenge for that element. Each is different and requires you to be come further attuned to that element. You can master an element up to three times. Gaining mastery one over an element allows you to craft runes of that element. Gaining further mastery allows you to power shape runes up with the same element further. For example, to get a level two fire effect in a single shape, you must have a mastery level of 2 or higher of fire.",

    "info.alteration.desc": "Alteration mutate the effect of an element from doing raw damage to something else. Each alteration and element combo has a different affect. Additionally, having higher powers of elements combined with an alteration may change the effect further by increasing in various ways. These effects vary from increasing the range on a blink spell to changing what set of items you can transmute to.|Unlocking alterations is different than unlocking other spell components. Instead of visiting shrines and undergoing trials, you simple need to advance as a mage. In less exciting words, you need to level up and invest points in technique, finesse, and control. By doing so, you can explore the attribute glyph in the Magic Mirror and unlock bonuses as well as alterations.",
    "info.spellmaking.name": "SpellCraft",
    "info.spellmaking.desc": "SpellCrafting is described more visually in the SpellCrafting book.||Crafting spells is as easy as combining trigger runes and loaded shape runes in a spell table. Shape runes are loaded up with elements and, optionally, alterations by combining shape runes with element and/or alteration runes in a crafting grid. These loaded shape runes are then placed along with trigger runes on a spell table to specify the effects and logic of the spell.|Spells always begin with a trigger. After the first trigger, there are some number of loaded shapes and triggers that follow. Spells follow a strict sequence of effects and stages defined by the sequence of triggers and shapes used to create the spell. A spell that starts with a self trigger followed by a delay trigger and then some shape will always first apply to the caster, wait some length of time defined by the delay trigger, and then apply the effects to the target (the caster). Some triggers may affect multiple players or mobs, in which case all parts of the spell that come after are applied to each player or mob affect. Building off the previous example, a spell that starts with a beam trigger that's followed by a delay trigger and then some effect will fire a beam from the caster. Each player or mob hit by the beam will then, after some delay, have the effects that follow the delay trigger applied to them.|To actually begin crafting a spell, you'll need to get runes. The easiest way to get runes is to find them as loot in dungeons. Runes are most readily found in shrines, but can found in most other dungeons as well. The most efficient way of gettings runes, however, is to craft them. In order to craft runes, you'll need to have already mastered that type of rune.

These are explained in the next section. Before getting started, you must unlocked the magic within you. If you are apprenticed to an existing mage, this is as easy as having them create a Writ of Learning. If you are not so lucky, you must perform the Pilgrimage of Discovery which is described in the following sections. Your first task should be to gather reagents.

However, experienced mages are able to craft the runes they need themselves instead of hunting them in the field. In order to craft runes like this, however, the mage must have mastery of the rune. As part of the Pilgrimage of Discovery, you unlocked knowledge of the elements as well as a trigger and Self runes. However, you only start with mastery of the trigger, Self, and Physical runes. In order to create any other runes, you must perform whichever ritual is required to attain mastery. The requirements are determined by the type of rune. Trigger mastery is as simple as visiting shrines and absorbing their energies. Elemental Runes first require finding the proper codex of pages as loot, and then performing the specialized rituals or feats as described in the codex. Elemental mastery also has tiers of mastery (Tier I, II, and III) whereas other rune types do not. Both Shape and Alteration runes are mastered in ways unknown. Whether you found them as loot or have crafted them, gather runes and reagents and helm to a Spell Table. In order to create a spell, you must supply a blank scroll. The spell is then made up of Triggers and loaded Shape runes. See the Spell Creation section for more information on the layout of runes and the rules of spell creation. After you make a spell, you get a spell scroll loaded with that spell. At this point you can right-click with the scroll to cast it for free -- all reagents required were infused at time of creation. When casting spells from scrolls, however, the scroll is used up immediately. For simple spells this is good enough. As you progress, however, you'll quickly need to find or craft a Spell Tome (see the following section) and perform the Ritual of Binding in order to bind the spell to the tome so that you can cast it repeatedly. In order to craft new and more exciting/powerful spells, you must find and master new runes. Mastering elements allows you to increase the potency of shapes and make existing spells more powerful.

It is incredibly important to take care of and protect any Spell Tomes to which you've become bound.

To actually form this bond, a player must enter a pact with the Tome. This is the Ritual of Bonding. The ritual begins with the collection of an unbound Spell Tome Pages and a tome cover, which can be found in shrine dungeons. A mage should take time to find tome components that will provide the neccessary balance between spell capacity, mana efficiency, any other special effects that may exist, and (of course) visual appeal. After such components are found, the mage should bring them to a ritual altar. To start the bonding process, the mage must perform the Ritual of Bonding, which will construct the tome from the cover and pages. At that point, the player will begin binding to the tome. To complete the binding process, they must hold the tome in their inventory for some period of time. Once enough time has passed and the Player has finished bonding, the tome will become firmly bonded. It can then be used to bind spells to and cast from.",

As you take damage, mana is spent to negate the damage instead of it damaging you. More mana is spent do negate larger attacks!|  To activate mana armor, you first have to create and use a Mana Armorer. This block is created through a ritual, and then can be placed in the world. On activation, it will start draining your mana to set up your mana armor. It takes 1000 mana to finish setting up your mana armor. The armorer block itself will draw this mana from you directly. If there are nearby mani or kani crystal blocks, they will help draw your mana out more quickly to hasten the process.|  Mana armor comes at a cost. While you have mana armor active, you will have reduced maximum mana to use. This maximum mana is returned to you once your mana armor is exhausted and fades.|  While you have mana armor activated, damage from most damage types will be negated. Some damage types will not be impacted and may kill you, including fall damage and falling out of the world.|  Your mana armor will stay activated until you run out of mana or die from damage that goes through your armor. Once it has been broken, you'll have to use a mana armorer again to activate it once more.|  Because mana armor covers your body and not your armor, your armor impacts how much damage the mana armor has to negate.
