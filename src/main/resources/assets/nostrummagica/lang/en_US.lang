info.shrines.desc=Shrines are an important part of Nostrum Magica. Scattered throughout throughout the world are shrines that contain a host of challenging mosters, loot, and (most importantly) aspected altars that help you unlock different spell components. Gaining mastery over more spell components is crucial to advanced in Nostrum Magica. In order to construct different spells, you'll need different shapes, triggers, and elements. Unlocking these involves visiting shrines. Finding shrines can be difficult. There are two items in Nostrum Magica that make this a little bit easier, but those are for you to find out. Element and Trigger shrines are much more common than shape shrines. There's guaranteed to be a Shrine of the Single shape near the worlds spawn location.
info.spells.name=Spells
info.spells.desc=Spells are made up of triggers and loaded shape components. Triggers contain the main logic of a spell. For example: the touch trigger specifies that the shape will affect the entity you're touching when you cast it; The health trigger sets off the spell once the target's health drops below a certain threshhold; The proximity trigger advances the spell once someone gets close enough to the spot it was placed. Loaded shape components contain the actual effects of the spell, from doing elemental damage to causing debuffs to transforming items into others. You can read more about constructing these components in the SpellCraft guide.|Spells can have multiple triggers in them, possible creating spells with multiple stages. If you have a spell that has a touch trigger followed by a delay trigger, the spell will start when cast by affecting whoever you were touching at the time. After that, any effects that directly follow the touch will be done, and then it will wait for the duration of the delay trigger. At that point the spell will proceed, performing any following effects and triggers until it ends. Constructing staged spells like this is a powerful component of Nostrum Magica, and allows you to create contingencies, delayed surprise attacks, and complex buff stacks.|The actual effect of a spell comes from the particular combination of elements and alterations on a spell shape. Any spell shape with only an element attached to it will do damage in that element. Alterations mutate the effects into others. For example, a shape with the physical element and the inflict alteration will reduce give weakness to the target. A shape with lightning and the support element will pull any nearby entities closer. You can read more about each type of spell component (triggers, element, shape, alteration) in their respective guide tabs.|Spells start with a trigger. As spells progress, they track (maybe different) entities: their target, and their auxillary target called 'other'. Sometimes these are the same thing: the self trigger targets the caster and keeps the caster as the spell's other. Other times, these differ: the touch trigger targets whoever was touched, but has the 'toucher' as the other. In most cases, the main target of the spell is probably who you are interested in affecting. In other cases, it's nice to be able to know and use the other. If you use spell debugging, you can see who the other is in each stage of the spell.
info.trigger.name=Triggers
info.trigger.desc=Triggers form the how and why of a spell. They form the stages of the spell and largely impact who is being targetted. The Self trigger instantly affects the caster. The beam trigger will cast the rest of the spell on all entities that were touched by the beam.|Unlocking triggers is the easiest of all components. To unlock them, you must simply find a shrine to the trigger and venture deep within. Once you locate the altar, you can interact with it to gain knowledge of the trigger. Be warned, though, as each shrine can only be used once. If a mage has already visited the shrine and taken the knowledge, you will be unable to unlock the trigger using that shrine and have to find another.
info.shape.name=Shapes
info.shape.desc=Shapes hold the effects of a spell. There are very few types of shapes which detail exactly who is affected by the spell. The Chain shape, for example, affects the target and some number of entities around them.|When constructing a spell, all the effects are determined by the shape runes. To add effects to a spell, you need to combine element and alteration runes with shapes runes to form filled shape runes. This is done simply by combining them in a crafting bench. Shape runes are loaded with some number of elements as well as optionally a single alteration. This combination (the number of elements and the alteration that's attached, if any) determine the actaul effect of the shape. You can have multiple shapes in a spell. Each will be performed on the target of the spell at that time. A more in-depth guide to creating filled shape runes can be found in the Spellcraft guide.|Shape shrines are much rarer than trigger and element shrines. The Single shape is easy to acquire: You simply interact with the altar in the shrine to get it. How to unlock the others, however, is a mystery...
info.element.name=Elements
info.element.desc=Nostrum Magica has seven elements: Fire, Ice, Wind, Earth, Lightning, Ender, and Physical. Each element results in different effects when combined with an alteration in a spell.|Elements are added to shape runes to form the effects of the spell. Elements can be added together to increase the effectiveness up to a maximum of tier 3. Combining two level 1 elemental runes together results in a level 2 elemental rune. To get a level three, you'll need the equivalent of 4 level 1 runes.|As part of unlocking magic, you automatically gain first level mastery over the Physical element. In order to master the other elements, you must form mastery orbs and offere them to shrines of those elements. After doing so, you will begin the challenge for that element. Each is different and requires you to be come further attuned to that element. You can master an element up to three times. Gaining mastery one over an element allows you to craft runes of that element. Gaining further mastery allows you to power shape runes up with the same element further. For example, to get a level two fire effect in a single shape, you must have a mastery level of 2 or higher of fire. 
info.alteration.name=Alterations
info.alteration.desc=Alteration mutate the effect of an element from doing raw damage to something else. Each alteration and element combo has a different affect. Additionally, having higher powers of elements combined with an alteration may change the effect further by increasing in various ways. These effects vary from increasing the range on a blink spell to changing what set of items you can transmute to.|Unlocking alterations is different than unlocking other spell components. Instead of visiting shrines and undergoing trials, you simple need to advance as a mage. In less exciting words, you need to level up and invest points in technique, finesse, and control. By doing so, you can explore the attribute glyph in the Magic Mirror and unlock bonuses as well as alterations.
info.spellmaking.name=SpellCraft
info.spellmaking.desc=SpellCrafting is described more visually in the SpellCrafting book.||Crafting spells is as easy as combining trigger runes and loaded shape runes in a spell table. Shape runes are loaded up with elements and, optionally, alterations by combining shape runes with element and/or alteration runes in a crafting grid. These loaded shape runes are then placed along with trigger runes on a spell table to specify the effects and logic of the spell.|Spells always begin with a trigger. After the first trigger, there are some number of loaded shapes and triggers that follow. Spells follow a strict sequence of effects and stages defined by the sequence of triggers and shapes used to create the spell. A spell that starts with a self trigger followed by a delay trigger and then some shape will always first apply to the caster, wait some length of time defined by the delay trigger, and then apply the effects to the target (the caster). Some triggers may affect multiple players or mobs, in which case all parts of the spell that come after are applied to each player or mob affect. Building off the previous example, a spell that starts with a beam trigger that's followed by a delay trigger and then some effect will fire a beam from the caster. Each player or mob hit by the beam will then, after some delay, have the effects that follow the delay trigger applied to them.|To actually begin crafting a spell, you'll need to get runes. The easiest way to get runes is to find them as loot in dungeons. Runes are most readily found in shrines, but can found in most other dungeons as well. The most efficient way of gettings runes, however, is to craft them. In order to craft runes, you'll need to have already mastered that type of rune. For example, you must have already visited a shrine to a Trigger and gained mastery before you can perform the ritual to craft it.|Trigger runes are used as-is. Shapes must be combined with elements and alterations before they can be used in a spell.|Creating spells on a spell table also requires the reagents the spell will cost to cast. Infusing the reagents at this time means that spell scrolls are free to cast. While construction your spell, you can view what current problems your spell has that prevent it from being created. For example, if you do not have enough mandrake root on the table, there will be a message declaring so.
info.spellbinding.name=Spell Binding
info.spellbinding.desc=After you make a spell, you'll have a spell scroll containing the spell. If you use the scroll, you'll cast the spell and use up the scroll. This is likely to be your only option at first, but eventually you'll want to bind your spells into tomes.|To bind a spell to a tome, you'll either need to perform the Ritual of Binding (tier III ritual) or undergo the more elaborate and expensive process of awakening your spell scroll.|The Ritual of Binding is a two-step process. The first step is simply to perform the tier III ritual. The tome used must be bound to you. If you are already in the process of binding another spell, it will be overwritten, forgotten, and lost! After performing the ritual, you will be directed to visit a shrine. The shrine is picked randomly from all the components that make up the spell. Simple visit a shrine to that component and right-click it to complete the binding. If you forget which shrine you need to visit, you can view it in the tome you are binding the spell to.|If you cannot perform the ritual, you can still bind spells to tomes by awakening the scroll. In order to awaken your scroll, you must first activate it by crafting it together with 4 diamonds and 4 ender pearl with the scroll in the center.|After activating the scroll, you must wait. After an extended period of time, you'll hear a tick. If you examine the scroll at that point, you should see it now is marked as 'Awakened'. Awakened scrolls should be used on pedestals that have the tome you wish to bind the spell into on it. Be warned though that if you are already binding a spell, it will be forgotten and lost. After beginning the binding process, you must visit a shrine just like as if you had performed the Ritual of Binding.
info.modification.name=Modification
info.modification.desc=Spell Tomes and some Spell Runes can be augmented by using the Modification Table. As tomes as used, they gain modification points. These points can be spent by adding additional Spell Tome Pages to the tome. This increases the discounts and bonuses the tome grants when casting from it. Additionally, certain runes (many types of triggers and shapes) can be modified as well. Modifications vary per rune type. For example, a chain shape can be modified to jump to an additional number of targets.|To perform modification, craft and place a modification table. Then, take the tome or rune you wish to modify to the table and place it in the top slot. If it is a tome, the stats of the tome will be displayed. Additionally, an input slot is presented as well. If the tome has modification points, you can place a spell tome page in the bottom slot and add it to the tome. The page and one modification point will be consumed.|If instead you place a rune in the modification table, you will be presented with the available modifications for the rune. Changing the values of the runes requires items be spent to perform the modification. The item needed is displayed as a shadow in the input slot. You can always modify a rune back to its original state for free.
info.tomes.name=Tomes
info.tomes.desc=When you craft a spell, you get a Spell Scroll. These are nice in that they require no reagents to cast, but are used up immediately. In order to cast a spell you've constructed repeatedly, you must bind the spell into a tome. To do that, you must perform a ritual.|Tomes are created by taking a Tome Plate (found as loot) and combining it with any number of pages in a ritual. The resultant tome has attributes that are determined by the plate and the pages used. Tomes have a maximum capacity for spells. Additionally, tomes can provide discounts on mana cost, increase the poficiency of spells cast out of them, or eliminate the need for reagents!|Tomes grow as you use them. To begin with, tomes can only cast spells below a certain mana cost. In order to cast more powerful spells from a tome, you must level it up by casting spells from it. As it levels up, it will gain a higher mana cap as well as modification points. You can use modification points to add additional pages to the tome, increasing its effectiveness and discounts.
info.rituals.name=Rituals
info.rituals.desc=Rituals are the advanced crafting in Nostrum Magica. Rituals are performed by burning reagents in candles and placing required items on pedestals.|There are three tiers of rituals. All rituals require candles, chalk, and reagents. More advanced (tier II and III) rituals also require pedestals and additional items.|Tier I rituals are extremely simple to set up. They require one candle surrounded by chalk. The candle must be lit, and the reagent specified in the ritual recipe must be burnt in the candle. Finally, an infused gem attuned to the right element should be used on the candle. If the ritual is set up correctly, the candle will be extinguished and the infused gem consumed.|Tier II and III rituals are much more complex. Firstly, they require either 1 (tier II) or 5 (tier III) ritual pedestals. They require much more chalk as well as 4 candles. Tier II rituals have a layout of a pedestal in a diamond of chalk. Candles are placed diagonal of the center pedestal with a circle of chalk around them. Tier III rituals are the same as tier II rituals except an extra pedestal is placed 4 blocks out in all four directions.|If those directions left you a little confused, don't worry: all ritual recipes are displayed fully graphically in the Rituals tab.|More advanced rituals require the use of attuned infused crystals. These are obtained using certain spells which you unlock with the Enchant alteration. You can unlock that by investing heavily in Technique.
info.levelup.name=Leveling Up
info.levelup.desc=As you cast spells, you will gain experience points. After gaining enough experience points, you will level up. Leveling up naturally increasings your maximum mana but also awards you a skill point to be spent. To spend skill points, you must make a Magic Mirror and look into it. The Magic mirror is where you put skillpoints into Technique, Finesse, or Control, which affects the types of spells you can cast. You can read more about what each affects by looking at the stats page in the Personal tab and hovering over the different attributes.|The magic mirror also has the attribute glyph. This glyph has tons of bonuses for you to unlock. Alterations are also unlocked via the glyph. In order to unlock new bonuses, you must progress along the glyph by first getting the required level or amount of Technique, Finesse, or Control. Some nodes in the glyph (challenge nodes) also have additional requirements, such as the defeat of a certain number of enemies or the casting of a spell with a certain element.
info.elementdamage.name=Elemental Damage
info.elementdamage.desc=Spell effects that aren't mutated by alterations are simply damage spells. The element that is at play, however, affects how much damage is actually delivered to the target. Each element affects targets differently. Each has a strength and a weakness.|Physical is the most basic damage type. It is equivalent to doing damage regularly, like attacking with a sword. It is the only element affected by armor and does the same amount of raw damage regardless of who the target is.|Fire damage is extra effective against undead enemies (150%%) and normally effective against everone else. This damage (like damage from all the other non-physical elements) ignores armor.|Lighting damage is more effective against heavily-armored opponents. Similarly, it is less effective than other types of magic against those wearing no armor. The base potency for lightning damage is only 75%%, but increases by 5%% for every point of armor (half-icon) they have.|Ender damage is, in general, more effective than other types. It has a base potency multiplier of 120%%. Ender damage does not affect ender mobs like Endermen and the Ender Dragon.|Earth damage is the most basic. Like other magical damage, it ignores armor. It does not recieve bonuses and penalties regardless of who you are attacking.|Ice damage is weak against undead. When applied to undead creatures, only 60%% of the damage is applied. Against living opponents, though, ice does 130%% what it normally would.|Wind damage is amplified when the target is lighter. Heavy targets aren't affected by wind as much. If the target is heavy, they'll only recieve 80%% damage. If they're light, however, they'll be dealt 180%% the original amount!
info.reagents.name=Reagents
info.reagents.desc=Casting spells from tomes costs reagents. Reagents can be in your inventory either directly or in reagent bags. Simple spells do not require reagents. More complicated spells will require reagents be available for use to help channel the required energies to conjure the spell.|Tome enhancements as well as special properties on some items may reduce the number of reagents you need. Some items have a property called Lower Reagent Cost, which reduces the amount of reagents spent (on average) when casting a spell. Other items provide completely free casts at some cost.|Lower Reagent Cost (LRC) works by providing a chance that each reagent that is required may not be needed. If, for example, you have a total LRC of 5%% and you cast a spell that requires three reagents, each reagent will make a roll against 5%% odds. If the roll succeeds, the reagent will not be required. Using LRC, you can get away with completely free casts even with a small discount. This, of course, won't happen in most cases. Each reagent is rolled against regardless of if multiple of that same reagent type is required. For example, a spell that requires two mandrake root at 5%% LRC will roll for each mandrake root.|Alternatively, some items eliminate reagent costs for a single cast. The Thano Pendant, for example, stores up XP to provide completely reagent-free casts in exchange for a charge. These effects usually require the item to be in one of your hands or equipped.
info.obelisks.name=Obelisks
info.obelisks.desc=Obelisks are a late-game structure you can use to teleport from one place to another. Obelisk work by storing multiple target destinations in the form of GeoTokens. Once a GeoToken has been added to an obelisk, it can not be removed.|GeoTokens should be added to an obelisk that point to another obelisk. Doing so will allow you to teleport from that obelisk to the other. In order to set up two-way teleportation, you need a GeoToken pointing back to the first obelisk in the second.

More complex spells will require higher attributes to cast. More info on this can be found in the Spells tab as well.

info.tamed_dragon.intro.name=Intro
info.tamed_dragon.intro.desc=Tamed dragons can be tamed only after subduing them. Once tamed, a young dragon will likely run around at random and basically pay no attention to you. Given enough time and training, however, your dragon could grow into a respectable fighter and loving companion!||There are a few ways you can interact with your dragon. First, your dragon can be instructed to sit. While sitting, it will not run around nor try to attack anything. When first tamed, tamed dragons start out sitting. Your dragon can be toggled in and out of sitting by shift-right clicking them.||If you right-click your dragon while it's sitting, you'll access its GUI. Here you can view information about the dragon. As your bond with the dragon progresses, you may find more ways you can interact with it in the menu...||When your dragon isn't sitting, it will be free to roam. Right-clicking on it while it's roaming will attempt to mount it. However, not all dragons can be ridden. You'll quickly find that even those that can be ridden may not be willing to let you ride them until it's gained some more trust.||Regardless of whether it's sitting or standing, if your dragon is injured and you're holding food, you will feed it by right-clicking it.||If your dragon lets you mount it, you control it similarly to how you control a horse: use the arrow keys to move around, and press space to jump. Unlike horses, dragons do not charge their jump. Depending on your dragon, you may be able to perform multiple jumps. If your dragon can fly or glide, it will begin to do so after a few jumps.||Be warned, however: tamed dragons are wild beasts when you first tame them.

guide.title=Nostrum Magica Guide
guide.page1=  Nostrum Magica is a magic mod that focuses on spell creation. The goal is to give you the ability to make the spells YOU want to have and use while providing a reasonable challenge and sense of progression. To do this, Nostrum Magica defines a spell system that revolves around spell components -- Triggers, Shapes, Elements, and Alterations. Spells then cost mana and physical reagents and do everything from healing to reducing attack to creating powerful gear!
guide.getting_started=Getting Started
guide.page2=  Getting started in Nostrum Magica requires a small number of resources you won't have right away. For example, you'll need to find a small handful of runes and a decent amount of most reagent types in order to create your first spell. Some of these materials are the same you use in Vanilla Minecraft: wood, iron, leather, paper, etc. Besides runes, the others are magic reagents, which come from a variety of sources. These are explained in the next section. Before getting started, you must unlocked the magic within you. If you are apprenticed to an existing mage, this is as easy as having them create a Writ of Learning. If you are not so lucky, you must perform the Pilgrimage of Discovery which is described in the following sections. Your first task should be to gather reagents. After you've built up a decent amount of each, hunt down runes. Runes can be found in dungeons as loot or in shrines. Once you have some triggers, shapes, and elements, craft a spell table and some blank scrolls and create your first spell.
guide.reagents=Magical Reagents
guide.page3=  Creating spells or casting spells from tomes requires reagents. The reagents required depend on the components of the spell. There are 7 different types of reagents. Each is a little bit different to obtain than the last.
guide.mandrake_root=Mandrake Root can be found in tall grass, just like vanilla seeds. It can be planted and grown like wheat. Mandrake Root is mainly used in spells with some form of materialization.
guide.black_pearl=Black Pearl is obtained by harvesting Midnight Irises, which can be found growing all over. Black Pearl is used in spells that require great amounts of energy.
guide.mani_dust=Mani Dust is found deep in the earth in the form of ore deposits. The dust is an important one for many non-spell items as well as spells that perform over an area.
guide.grave_dust=Grave Dust is soil that was used to bury someone and sanctified. Undead are sure to have a couple of pinches of the stuff.
guide.ginseng=Ginseng is found just like mandrake root; find it in grass and plant it to grow more. Ginseng is used in spells that are restorative.
guide.sky_ash=As magic is released into the sky, it mixes and eventually falls back down in the form of Sky Ash. Naturally, trees are a good source of the powder.
guide.spider_silk=Spider silk is strong yet smooth. These properties lend themselves to spell components that are binding.
guide.discovery=Pilgrimage of Discovery
guide.page4=  The Pilgrimage of Discovery is performed to unlock the magic potential in the player. The ritual requires the player to travel far and wide in search of special shrines. While some shrines have ferocious bosses in them, most have a portal to the Sorcery Dimension nestled deeply within. You must find one of these portals and jump inside, transporting yourself to the sorcery dimension, to begin your journey as a mage. One you're in the dimension, you will be presented with a series of challenges that will help unlock magic. After you've unlocked magic, more challenges will be available for you to complete in order to become a more powerful mage.
guide.first_steps=First Steps
guide.page5=  Creating spells requires runes. Most runes can be found as loot in dungeons or shrines. However, experienced mages are able to craft the runes they need themselves instead of hunting them in the field. In order to craft runes like this, however, the mage must have mastery of the rune. As part of the Pilgrimage of Discovery, you unlocked knowledge of the elements as well as a trigger and Self runes. However, you only start with mastery of the trigger, Self, and Physical runes. In order to create any other runes, you must perform whichever ritual is required to attain mastery. The requirements are determined by the type of rune. Trigger mastery is as simple as visiting shrines and absorbing their energies. Elemental Runes first require finding the proper codex of pages as loot, and then performing the specialized rituals or feats as described in the codex. Elemental mastery also has tiers of mastery (Tier I, II, and III) whereas other rune types do not. Both Shape and Alteration runes are mastered in ways unknown. Whether you found them as loot or have crafted them, gather runes and reagents and head to a Spell Table. In order to create a spell, you must supply a blank scroll. The spell is then made up of Triggers and loaded Shape runes. See the Spell Creation section for more information on the layout of runes and the rules of spell creation. After you make a spell, you get a spell scroll loaded with that spell. At this point you can right-click with the scroll to cast it for free -- all reagents required were infused at time of creation. When casting spells from scrolls, however, the scroll is used up immediately. For simple spells this is good enough. As you progress, however, you'll quickly need to find or craft a Spell Tome (see the following section) and perform the Ritual of Binding in order to bind the spell to the tome so that you can cast it repeatedly. In order to craft new and more exciting/powerful spells, you must find and master new runes. Mastering elements allows you to increase the potency of shapes and make existing spells more powerful. Alterations change what the spell does. Triggers add stages to the spells to create complex sequences of actions.
guide.spell_tomes=Spell Tomes
guide.page6=Spell Tomes hold a collection of spells for a mage to visit later and cast again. Spell tomes are more than mere books, however. A tome exists as a physical channel to the mind of the mage. Because of this, only the bound mage can safely use a spell tome. When others try to use it, the tome will likely be damaged and may lose spells. The lifeforce of the bound mage will likely be affected as well. It is incredibly important to take care of and protect any Spell Tomes to which you've become bound. To aid in this, various improvements and enchantments can be instilled in a tome, such as the ability to lock itself if you die. The extent of known tome enchantments is a topic currently unknown.
guide.rituals=Rituals
guide.page7=Rituals are the advanced crafting system in Nostrum Magica. Rituals have one or more candles and some number of pedestals. Reagents are burnt in lit candles to form the basis of the Ritual. More complicated rituals take specific items on pedetals.
guide.candle=Candles can be lit by normal means. Reagents can then be used to burn them. Candles do not stay lit forever.
guide.pedestal=Pedestals hold the items used by higher-tier rituals.
guide.page8=There are 3 tiers of rituals. Tier 1 has one candle that is surrounded by chalk and can only perform basic rituals. Tier 2 and 3 take both reagents and items and perform much more powerful outcomes, but require pedestals to perform. To construct pedestals, you'll need to find some Kani crystals, which can usually be found as loot in Shrines.
guide.tier1=Tier 1
guide.tier2=Tier 2
guide.tier3=Tier 3
guide.tier1_desc=Tier 1 is simply a candle surrounded by chalk.
guide.tier2_desc=Tier 2 has a pedestal in the center in a diamond of chalk. In each corner is a candle.
guide.tier3_desc=Start with tier 2. Surround the candles with chalk and add pedestals 4 blocks out from the center.
guide.page9=Rituals are performed by burning the required reagents in the candles and (for higher-tier rituals) placing the items on the pedestals. You should mind that your candles don't go out while you're setting up. To actually perform the ritual, a gem infused to the correct element should then be used on the center (candle or altar). The type of gem required is specified by the ritual recipe, which can be viewed at the end of this guide. If everything is in place, the ritual will commence and any effect produced will be granted. All reagents and items used in the ritual will be destroyed.
guide.ritual_bonding=Ritual of Bonding
guide.page10=Not to be confused with the Ritual of Binding, the Ritual of Bonding bonds a player to a Spell Tome. The order of that phrasing is important: the PLAYER is bound to the Tome. As discussed in the previous section, Spell Tomes are more than mere spell vessels. In the wrong hands, a Spell Tome is an exceptional weapon against the mage to whom it is bound. To actually form this bond, a player must enter a pact with the Tome. This is the Ritual of Bonding. The ritual begins with the collection of an unbound Spell Tome Pages and a tome cover, which can be found in shrine dungeons. A mage should take time to find tome components that will provide the neccessary balance between spell capacity, mana efficiency, any other special effects that may exist, and (of course) visual appeal. After such components are found, the mage should bring them to a ritual altar. To start the bonding process, the mage must perform the Ritual of Bonding, which will construct the tome from the cover and pages. At that point, the player will begin binding to the tome. To complete the binding process, they must hold the tome in their inventory for some period of time. Once enough time has passed and the Player has finished bonding, the tome will become firmly bonded. It can then be used to bind spells to and cast from.

spellcraft.title=Spell Crafting Guide
spellcraft.intro=Crafting spells is a core part of Nostrum Magica. Because of the high complexity of spells, spell creation is a complicated process with many parts. This guide book does exactly that: break down all the pieces of spell creation so that you can learn how it's done.
spellcraft.spelltable=Spell Tables
spellcraft.spelltable_intro1=The Spell Table is where you will create runes. The table provides an interface for bringing runes and reagents together to create a spell.
spellcraft.spelltable_intro2=The main component of the Spell Table interface is the rune sequencing section. Above that is the name input line, the submit button, and the status indicator. Below the rune sequencing section are 9 reagent slots where reagents used for spell creation are placed.
spellcraft.runes=Runes
spellcraft.runes_intro=Spells are made up of triggers, shapes, elements, and alterations. All spells begin with a trigger. Afterwards, there are some number of triggers and shapes runes. Trigger runes are placed in as-is. Shapes should first be combined with elements and optionally alterations before using them in spells.
spellcraft.runes_shapes1=Shapes are the most complex part of the spell. Shape runes are combined with element runes and alteration runes to form the actual effects of the spell. Element runes can be combined together in a crafting bench. Alterations, Elements, and Shapes are also combined by crafting them together.
spellcraft.runes_shapes2=A Shape can only have one type of element, but can be powered up to your mastery level of the element. Shapes can also be slotted with one Alteration. Alterations and Shapes are what determine the actual effect of the spell. Each element and alteration combination yields a different effect. Using higher powered elements in a single shape increases the effectiveness of the effect. If there is no alteration, this means that shape will apply more damage to the target. Mutated effects caused by Alterations are also affected by the power level of the element in the shape.
spellcraft.runes_shapes3=Trigger runes create different stages of the spell. Triggers can come anywhere in the spell, as long as the spell starts with a trigger. By placing shapes between triggers, you can create spells that do one effect before transitioning to another target or waiting for some time, etc.
spellcraft.reagents=Reagents
spellcraft.reagents_info=Creating a spell requires that the reagents used to cast the spell be provided at the time the spell is created. The reagents that are required by the spell are determined by the components of the spell. Reagents are taken from the tables reagents slots.
spellcraft.finishing=Finishing The Spell
spellcraft.finishing_info=After constructing a sequence of runes, you must name your spell. You can do this with the name field above the rune sequencing area. After supplying the name, you will be able to craft the spell as long as there are no errors in your sequence and you have the reagents required.
spellcraft.problems=Problems
spellcraft.problems_info=There are some requirements when creating a spell. Firstly, all spells must start with a trigger. Spells must contain at least one shape that has an element associated with it. Spells must have a name. Lastly, you must have enough reagents in the table's reagent slots to pay for the spell. If all of these are true, the submit button will be activated. If not, however, the error indicator will display a red X and the problems will be listed.

research.origin.desc=Expanding your knowledge
research.origin.info=  Through careful planning and study, you are able to discover new and untold facets of magic.|  This research tab is automatically updated with new entries as you discover things in real life, gain levels, and progress on the attribute list. Each new node in the research tree costs 1 Research Point in order to unlock, but expands your knowledge of the world and reveals new rituals and features. As you discover more and more, new tabs will show up on the bottom of the screen allowing you to switch between the many different categories of research.||  Note that enraveling new research topics requires a research point. You get new points every time you level up in Nostrum Magica. Additionally, you build progress towards new points by collecting new lore. This can be seen as the yellow bar below the research points display at the bottom of the research screen.
research.spellcraft.name=Spellcraft
research.spellcraft.desc=Use runes, reagents, and scrolls to craft your own spells
research.spellcraft.info=  Spellcraft is the process of taking runes, reagents, and a blank spell scroll to the Spell Table and creating a spell. Spells in NostrumMagica are made up of different spell components that define the mechanics and effects of the spell.|  See the SpellCraft guide for more information!
research.spelltomes.name=Spell Tomes
research.spelltomes.desc=Somewhere to put your scrolls
research.spelltomes.info=  Spell Tomes are a mages best friend, allowing them to have multiple spells in a single slot while also granting permanent access to that spell -- provided they have enough mana and reagents.|Spell Tomes are created from tome plates, which dictate how many spells the spell tome can have bound at one time.|Spell tomes gain experience as they are used, allowing them to channel more powerful spells and gaining modification slots!
research.spellbinding.name=Spellbinding
research.spellbinding.desc=Bind a spell to a Spell Tome
research.spellbinding.info=  Spell Tomes are useless without having spells bound into them. Binding a spell to a tome permanently adds the spell to the tome, but grants the player access to an infinite number of casts. Note that casting will require mana and reagents in this way.
research.spelltomes_advanced.name=Spell Tome Pages
research.spelltomes_advanced.desc=Enhancements for the Spell Tome
research.spelltomes_advanced.info=  Spell Tome pages are magical items that carry with them enhancements that can be applies to spelltomes. The effects of these enhancements include making spells bound to the tome cost less magic, or award the mage with more experience.|  Spell Tome pages can be bound into the spell tome when creating the spell tome. A more advanced mage might know how to use modification points from leveling up the tome to add even more...
research.elemental_trials.name=Elemental Trials
research.elemental_trials.desc=Gaining mastery over the elements
research.elemental_trials.info=  When attuning to an element in the Sorcery Dimension, you start out with a basic understanding of the element. This is enough to create and cast spells with that element in it, but only with basic potency. In order to truly harness the power of the element and maximize the effects it has in a spell, you'll need to gain mastery over the element.|  Elemental mastery is gained by performing one of the elemental trials. Each trial is started by creating a Mastery Orb and then bringing it to an altar of the element within the Sorcery Dimension. Using the orb on the altar will begin the trial.|  Descriptions of each trial are available on the info page and are linked on the following page.
research.rituals.name=Rituals
research.rituals.desc=Light the candels and dim the lights...
research.rituals.info=You don't know how you knew to do it, but you have done it. There at your feet is a candle. Atop its wick dances an orange flame, and a dark purple smoke drifts up from it. The reagent you added burned up nicely. The chalk you surrounded the candle with seems to be helping as well. The final step is to provide a catalyst for the transformation. The ritual is almost complete...|  Rituals are an advanced crafting system in Nostrum Magica. Rituals involve creating shapes with chalk, lighting candles, burning reagents, and using void or attuned gems. More advanced rituals also require additional items placed on altars.|  All available rituals can be viewed in the info screen, which also demonstrates how to set them up. Additionally, the rituals guide under Guides on the info screen describes rituals in more detail.
research.candles.name=Ritual Candles
research.candles.desc=and their proper usage
research.candles.info=  Candles are one of the main blocks used to perform a ritual. As you know, you light them with flint and steel, burn a reagent in them, and then perform the spell. At this point the candles go out.|  Over time, however, you've discovered a few more things about the candles. Firstly, candles that don't have reagents burned in them never go out. Additionally, candles with netherrack beneath them (or 2 blocks below them!) stay lit even after a ritual has been performed!|  Lastly, candles can be fed reagents by simply dropping them on them instead of right-clicking on them. If a whole stack is dropped on a candle, it'll consume 1 at a time.
research.boon.name=Boons
research.boon.desc=Apply extended magical effects through rituals
research.boon.info=  Boons provide a way of applying positive status effects for longer periods of times than simple spells could manage.
research.sorceryportal.name=Sorcery Portals
research.sorceryportal.desc=Learn how to conjure sorcery portals for faster trips into the sorcery dimension
research.sorceryportal.info=  Sorcery portals are usually found in dungeons. However, through advanced ritual work, you've found a way to spawn a portal wherever you desire.||  Note that the portal will replace the center of the ritual, costing you at least one altar.
research.geogems.name=Geogems
research.geogems.desc=Remembering a location
research.geogems.info=  You've tinkered with infusing regular things with magic essences before. This time, you've wondered what the raw energy contained in a kani crystal would do if combined with something tied to position, like a compass.|  The result is a geogem. Compasses, through some more primitive magic, point to your bed. Geogems don't point at all, but through the steady raw magic of the kani crystal have a sort of 'memory' and stay linked to the location you pair them to. You feel certain you can find ways to use this!|  To set the position contained in a geo gem, simply right-click the block with the geogem in hand. 
research.geotokens.name=Geotokens
research.geotokens.desc=Strengthening the link
research.geotokens.info=  Geogems are great for remembering locations, but are somewhat fickle. They can easily be reset and only have a loose link to the location stored. Luckily, you have a plan. By encasing the geogem in a token and supplying it with more raw energy from another kani gem and infusing it with the steady power of an earth gem, you can make a Geotoken. Geotokens, like geogems, store a position. However, geotokens cannot be changed once formed.
research.markrecall.name=Mark and Recall
research.markrecall.desc=The bread and butter of teleporation magic
research.markrecall.info=  Your work with geogems has inspired you to investigate teleportation magics more directly. By combining your knowledge of enderpearls with the raw location-bound energies of a compass -- and with the stability of earth for anchoring and the freedom of wind for the travel -- you've managed to fine tune or Mark the location your own aether is drawn to. Similarly, you've created a way to tap into those energies and recall back to that location nearly instantly.
research.obelisks.name=Obelisks
research.obelisks.desc=Waypoint teleporation
research.obelisks.info=  Finally! You've found it!|  With the stability of the balanced slabs you've just discovered, the location storage of geotokens, and the power of vani crystals, you've discovered a way to create easy, permanent teleportation options!|  By performing the ritual and erecting an obelisk, you create a waypoint you can teleport to and from. You have found that linking two obelisks together is as simple as bringing a geotoken pointing to one obelisk in contact with another obelisk, and just like that, the obelisk will be able to send you to the other.|  You also have found a pretty basic ritual which can return you to an obelisk, provided you have a geogem that remembers where it's at.
research.summonkoids.name=Void Conjuring
research.summonkoids.desc=Spawn koids
research.summonkoids.info=  You think back to your last encounter with a koid and ponder where the creatures came from. It seems obvious that each koid is linked to one of the elements. In fact, the koids seem like little more than undirected balls of energy with a slight elemental attunement!|  You've discovered that this is easy to prove. All it requires is the energy from a kani gem, some direction, and a little bit of magic essence.
research.loretable.name=Researcher's Table
research.loretable.desc=A researcher's best friend
research.loretable.info=  Researcher tables are simple tables that allow a mage to examine magical objects more closely. The mani gem inside helps focus energies over time, which usually causes the object to react in one way or another.|  Leaving objects in the researcher's table provides furtehr insight into the object, providing additional lore about it.
research.magic_token.name=Magic Tokens
research.magic_token.desc=Basic resource crafting
research.magic_token.info=  Rituals allow you combine the essence of reagents into other items, or to help materialize the raw essence itself. You immediately can see that some of the products of these rituals are useful as materials for other rituals as well. The first example you've found is a Magic Token.|  Magic tokens are just materialized 'void' or non-elemental energy, conjured from mani dust. You have deemed this process "Barr's Enchantment."
research.magic_token_3.name=Barr's Enchantement II
research.magic_token_3.desc=Improving the recipe
research.magic_token_3.info=  Barr's Enchantment works well enough, and only costs 1 mani dust and 1 void gem. Void gems aren't the cheapest, however.|  To try and remedy this, you ponder the effects of adding more reagents. You wonder if most of the void energy is being lost due to lack of material. You quickly discover that you are right!
research.kani.name=Kani Crystals
research.kani.desc=More powerful mani crystals
research.kani.info=  You've discovered that mani crystals have many different uses in rituals and in more mundane crafting. The raw magical energy contained within provides the energy that makes a lot of the imbuement you're doing work.|  But... what are mani crystals? They're just diamonds combined with mani dust.|  After basic tinkering, you find that you cannot simply pack on more mani dust and get a more powerful crystal. Perhaps the diamond is holding all of the power that it can. Something in your gut tells you that's not quite right.|  Using your knowledge of rituals and the concepts of using reagents as material, you've discovered a way to get even stronger crystals. By adding more mani dust with additional reagents and using a void crystal, you've created the next tier of crystal...|  the kani crystal!
research.vani.name=Vani Crystals
research.vani.desc=Even stronger mani crystals
research.vani.info=  You've spent a long time on this one. The leap from mani crystal to kani crystal wasn't too bad. It wasn't easy to know to use more reagents and a void gem to get a stronger gem, but you discovered it eventually. The next step took much, much longer.|  Originally, you tried adding more mani dust by simply repeating the same kani infusion ritual on a kani gem. You tried hammering more dust in, sprinkling more on, and even naively imbuing more. And yet all of your attempts failed.|  But all at once an idea struck you. Perhaps you weren't thinking dramatically enough. If the leap between a mani crystal and a kani crystal required dramatically different amounts of magic, maybe the same was true to create something bigger than a kani crystal. This turned out to be true.|  By infusing a kani crystal with the additional power of FOUR more kani crystals, applying some reagents for stability, and using the power of a void gem, you have finally created a more powerful crystal.
research.spellrunes.name=Spell Runes
research.spellrunes.desc=DIY runes
research.spellrunes.info=  You've found that runes go quite quickly once you start experimenting with different spell effects, or when creating complicated compound spells. Looting runes from dungeons isn't going to cut it.|  Using what you've learned about imbuing materials with essences of others, you've discovered a method of making spell runes. You suspect you can make a rune of any shape, trigger, or alteration that you've learned. You don't know enough about other elements, alterations, shapes, or triggers to really know what would be involved in creating a rune that shared their essence.
research.fierce_infusion.name=Fierce Infusion
research.fierce_infusion.desc=Elemental aggression
research.fierce_infusion.info=  Through your exploration of magic and spells, you've come to realize that Fire, Wind, and Lightning are elements that tend towards more aggressive and ferocious effects. You suspect this stems from some inate property of each element, but don't know more than that.|  Using this theory, though, you've discovered a ritual that creates a slab infused with each element, perfectly demonstrating ferocity.
research.kind_infusion.name=Kind Infusion
research.kind_infusion.desc=Elemental compassion
research.kind_infusion.info=  Ice, Wind, and Ender have offensive components, but also deal a lot more with support. A common theme of all elements is providing aid in some way.|  Using these elements, you've learned to create an item that perfectly holds this exact energy of kindness.
research.balanced_infusion.name=Balanced Infusion
research.balanced_infusion.desc=Elemental completeness
research.balanced_infusion.info=  With the creation of the fierce and kind slabs, it's clear that there's something more complete. To that end, you've created the balanced slab -- which takes the best parts of both and combines them.|  This item resonates with power. It doesn't seem to do much on its own, but you are certain you can find a use for it...
research.reagent_bag.name=Reagent Bags
research.reagent_bag.desc=Bag of holding (reagents)
research.reagent_bag.info=  In order to be a powerful mage, you likely need to cast a lot of spells. The reagent cost of more powerful spells stacks up quickly, however. To help with this, you've created a magical bag for holding reagents!|  The reagent bag is opened like most backpacks -- simply put it in your hands and use it. The bag has room for plenty of reagents, but can't hold other types of items.|  When casting spells that require reagents, they'll automatically look inside of and deduct from reagent bags.
research.rune_bag.name=Rune Bags
research.rune_bag.desc=  Rune master
research.rune_bag.info=Like reagent bags, rune bags are magical bags that allow you to hold more runes than you normally would. Also like reagent bags, rune bags can only hold runes, and cannot hold other type of items.
research.charms.name=Magical Charms
research.charms.desc=Adventuring tools
research.charms.info=  Through careful ritual work, you've discovered a way to create small charms of magical power. The charms are stable, but can be activated to unleash a burst of attuned magical energy. This energy does different things depending on the element.|  Fire was the first one you tried, and your house burned down. Earth was next, and the cave you were hiding in was suddenly much bigger.|  You had hoped wind would allow you to fly, but it instead sent your enemies flying. Physical allowed you to run much faster, and ice guarded your flight.|  Lightning called down bolts, and ender returned you home.
research.mage_staff.name=Mage Staves
research.mage_staff.desc=More than a walking stick
research.mage_staff.info=  Mages staves are tools and weapons. They allow a mage to cast spells at a higher potency, and with less overall reagent cost. They also double for decent weapons in a pinch.
research.thanos_staff.name=Thanos Staff
research.thanos_staff.desc=Combat magery
research.thanos_staff.info=  Staves of Thanos take some of the best parts of mages staves and thano pendants and smash them together. The staff gains energy off of collected experience, like a thano pendant, and eventually provides a reagent-free cast. It also augments your magical abilities, and acts like a decent melee weapon.
research.enchanted_armor.name=Magic Armor
research.enchanted_armor.desc=Magic protection
research.enchanted_armor.info=  Most pieces of armor are great at reducing the danger of a sword... but defending against magic is another story!|By imbuing otherwise-useless ethereal armor with magical elements, you've discovered a way to make armor that reduces magic damage! What's more, some of it is even better at reducing physical damage, too!
research.enchanted_armor_adv.name=Awakened Armors
research.enchanted_armor_adv.desc=Unlocking latent power
research.enchanted_armor_adv.info=  You've discovered a way to power your magical armor even further. Imbuing further with elements doesn't seem to do much, but augmenting with the strength of obsidian and using a slab to unlock their potential has uncovered extra abilities that were previously dormant in the armor.|  Advanced armors (when wearing a full set) allow the wearer to use mana to gain extra jumps. The cost is not cheap, but as an experienced mage, you're not too worried.||  Corrupted armors provide different armor attributes and features than their uncorrupted counterparts. Additionally, the elytra that was used in the ritual can be used to glide as if wearing an elytra!|NOTE: Elytra is not used up during ritual!||  True armors allow the wearer to soar with the wings of a dragon. They work similarly to elytras, except using mana and the power of the dragon wings attached, the wearer can fly straight or even upward!
research.enchanted_weapons.name=Enchanted Weapons
research.enchanted_weapons.desc=Blades of the elements
research.enchanted_weapons.info=  Much like enchanted armor, you've discovered a way to create weapons attuned to the elements. The elements that didn't work well for armor -- Wind, Ice, and Lightning -- have turned out to be great for making weapons.|  Each weapon is different. What's more, the weapons have neat effects when used.
research.warlock_sword.name=Warlock Blade
research.warlock_sword.desc=Ensorcelled blades
research.warlock_sword.info=  Warlock Blades are very powerful weapons. Their raw attack power is on par with a diamond blade, and they provide a modest boost to your magical potency.|  The blades are imbued with a lot of magical energy. However, this energy is unattuned. While fighting elemental enemies (such as golems or koids), your blade will attune to the elements it comes into contact with. As it gains power, it may begin applying magic damage on top of the physical damage it deals.
research.mirror_shield.name=Mirror Shields
research.mirror_shield.desc=Back at'cha!
research.mirror_shield.info=  Finally, a practical application for magic! In order to improve your magical protection beyond what enchanted armor can give you, you've decided to try to affix a sort of mirror to a shield. You hope this will allow it to reduce and reflect magical damage!||  The mirror shield provides a passive bonus to magical and physical damage when held in your offhand. When blocking with it and struct by a magical attack, however, 20% of the magical effect will be reflected back at the caster instead of hitting you.
research.true_mirror_shield.name=True Mirror Shields
research.true_mirror_shield.desc=The real deal
research.true_mirror_shield.info=  Mirror shields are incredibly useful for defending against magic attackers. They even can reflect some of the attacking magic back at the caster!|  You've decided to try augmenting the shields with more vani crystal in an attempt to further reduce incoming magical effects.||  True mirror shields, like regular ones, provide passive bonuses to magical resistance. When blocking with them, they redirect 30% of effects back at the caster.|  The powerful crystal at the top of the shield provides even more benefit. When not actively blocking with the shield, the shield will instead absorb some of the magical energies to charge the crystal. Once the crystal is charged (turns a bright blue), blocking a magical attack will redirect 100% of the effects back at the caster.
research.hookshot_medium.name=Farshots
research.hookshot_medium.desc=An upgraded hookshot
research.hookshot_medium.info=  Hookshots are great for moving around forests and jungles where there's always some wood nearby. You've devised a way to extend the reach of the hookshot and slightly expand the number of things it can hook into by enchanting iron with a Kani gem and infusing it into the hookshot. You call it... the Farshot!
research.hookshot_strong.name=Grand Hookshots
research.hookshot_strong.desc=Further than a Farshot
research.hookshot_strong.info=  Using the same idea as before, you've experimented with infusing metal with Vani gems and have substantially increased the range and hooking ability of the hookshot!
research.hookshot_claw.name=Clawshots
research.hookshot_claw.desc=Within my grasp
research.hookshot_claw.info=  Grand hookshots are a huge improvement over the hookshot and farshot. You can reach very far away, and pull yourself to anything. There's only one thing missing.|  Clawshots have the same reach and hook potential as grand hookshots, but don't automatically release when you've been pulled to your destination. Instead, you remain hooked in place!|  Shifting while hooked in place will deactivate the clawshot. Additionally, using another hookshot from your other hand will also deactivate it after the other hookshot has hooked onto something.|  A clawshot and another hookshot is an effective combo for scaling convex walls where a single hookshot would not cut it. Two clawshots in each hand lets the shooter travel wherever they want even along vertical stretches!
research.modification_table.name=Modification Tables
research.modification_table.desc=The worlds strongest table
research.modification_table.info=  The modification table unlocks a lot of potential, and works on several different items.|  Firstly, spell tomes may be placed on the table to spend modification points in exchange for adding new spell tome pages, improving various stats of the tome.|  Many runes can be added to the table and augmented as well. For example, an Area of Effect rune's size can be increased in exchange for various items.|  Finally, spell scrolls can be placed on the table to change their icon in exchange for a little bit of dye.
research.stat_items.name=Skill Items
research.stat_items.desc=Permanent skill increases
research.stat_items.info=  You've discovered that the mystic, powerful roses that the golems drop can be used in the craft of very powerful magical items. The power of each item is so great, it will increase one of your stats permanently!
research.stat_items_adv.name=Primordial Mirrors
research.stat_items_adv.desc=Wildcards
research.stat_items_adv.info=  Although much more lossy than the previous skill items, you've created a new type -- the primordial mirror -- which awards a skill point instead of increasing one of your stats. This allows you to spec into whichever stat you want, and is a great option if you have many of one type of rose but do not need its corresponding stat increase.
research.stat_items_wing.name=More Primordial Mirrors
research.stat_items_wing.desc=Giving your skillpoints flight
research.stat_items_wing.info=  Dragon wings turned out to be much much better for creating primordial mirrors.
research.ender_pin.name=Ender Pins
research.ender_pin.desc=Personal portals
research.ender_pin.info=  Through your exposure to the portals to the sorcery dimension, and the portals spawned by the obelisk, you've gained a decent familiarity with portals. Through quite a lot of experimenting and exploring, you've finally found a way to expand upon what you know.|  By combining ender bristles and wisp pebbles into a beautiful dazzling gem filled with teleportation potential, you've created an item that allows you to permanently unlock the potential to open up portals for teleportation.|  After using the item and unlocking portals, several different teleportation techniques will begin opening portals instead of just teleporting you. For example, performing the recall ritual will open a portal.
research.thano_pendant.name=Thano Pendants
research.thano_pendant.desc=Mysterious!
research.thano_pendant.info=  Finally! You've had a breakthrough. The pendant fragments you had been finding seemed quite magical, but somehow different than what you had experienced before. After much, much work and effort, you've finally found how to recombine them, and the product is certainly different than anything youv've seen so far.|  Thano pendants are items that absorb magical power from experience you collect. Any experience collected will help power the pendants. Once the pendants have enough energy stored, they produce a 'charge' which allows you to cast a magical spell... without using reagents!||  Thano pendants will absorb energy from experience anywhere in your inventory. However, they will only provide reagent-free casts when in one of your hands while casting the spell. This is somewhat unweildly, but holding it in your offhand doesn't seem too bad.
research.ribbons.name=Ribbons
research.ribbons.desc=Fashionable mana storage
research.ribbons.info=  By infusing wool with mani dust and crystals, you've discovered a new way to store mana! By crafting a ribbon out of wool infused as such, you effectively expand your pool of useable mana!
research.ribbons_enhanced.name=Enhanced Ribbons
research.ribbons_enhanced.desc=Edgier mana storage
research.ribbons_enhanced.info=  Ribbons expand your available mana. But by imbuing them with a kind or fierce slab, you can rework this boon into something different. Using a fierce slab, you can nearly double the amount of mana, in exchange for reduced mana regen rate. Alternatively, using a kind slab removes all bonus mana, but applies a huge bonus to regen rate!
research.rings.name=Rings
research.rings.desc=Metallurgical magic
research.rings.info=  Like cloth, you've discovered rings make for excellent magical baubles as well. You've discovered silver allows magic to flow freely, reducing the amount of mana you expel when casting. Gold has the opposite effect, but lets you cast more powerful spells!
research.rings_true.name=True Rings
research.rings_true.desc=Honing the craft
research.rings_true.info=  Through some tinkering, you've discovered the potency bonus from gold rings can be enhanced by infusing the ring with the energies of a Fierce Tablet. Similarly, Silver is augmented with a Kind Tablet. These enhanced version of the rings bring out the true potential of the ring!
research.rings_corrupted.name=Corrupted Rings
research.rings_corrupted.desc=Corrupting what was pure
research.rings_corrupted.info=  What would happen if you infused a Silver Ring with a fierce tablet, you wonder? Ultimately, you've discovered how to make corrupted rings. These rings primarly boost the original stat, but have been twisted...
research.belts.name=Magic Belts
research.belts.desc=Some success in failure...
research.belts.info=  Despite all your efforts, you don't seem to be able to infuse leather with magic reagents. You were able to attach a magical gem, however. You've devised two such belts: One aspected to Ender, and the other to Lightning.
research.shield_rings.name=Shield Rings
research.shield_rings.desc=Automatic aether shields
research.shield_rings.info=  In a similar fashion to Aen pendants, you've fashioned a ring that can draw aether from items in your inventory to provide a magical shield.|  Note that the rings require items that provide aether in your inventory.
research.elude_capes.name=Elusion Capes
research.elude_capes.desc=I'm over here
research.elude_capes.info=  Like shield rings, you've found that cloth items make for good channelers of aether.|  You've sewn together a cape that allows you to occasionally dodge out of the way of an incoming attack.|  Note that the cape will only work if you're looking at your attacker. Additionally, it will not work if you do not have aether.
research.teleportrune.name=Teleportation Runes
research.teleportrune.desc=A teleporting home owner
research.teleportrune.info=  You've created a way to teleport yourself short distances away at basically no cost.|  Teleportation runes work by pointing to another rune and teleporting whoever stands on it. Simple stand on top, wait a moment, and then open your eyes to find yourself at the linked rune.|  Teleportation runes have a pretty limited range. However, they are also pretty cheap to construct and set up. They are perfect for in-base teleportation!||Creative note:|  In creative mode, you can point a teleportation rune to any location, including locations that don't have runes at them or locations that are very far away.
research.putter.name=Putters
research.putter.desc=Smart droppers!
research.putter.info=  Rituals have allowed you to enhance droppers to be a little smarter.|  Putters, like droppers, drop items into the world. However, putters drop items when there's no redstone signal. Additionally, putters will only put out an item if there's not already an item in front of it. If there's still an item on the ground, it simply will do nothing!|  What's more, putters also refresh items on the ground, ensuring they never despawn.|  Putters can be disabled by providing a redstone signal.
research.active_hopper.name=Active Hopper
research.active_hopper.desc=Greedy hoppers
research.active_hopper.info=  After upgrading droppers, you decided to try and improve on hoppers. And, thankfully, you've succeeded.|  Active hoppers are like regular hoppers in that they can pull items on top of them in -- including from inventories adjacent. Additionally, they can output items into inventories they're pointed at.|  There are several differences, however. Firstly, active hoppers always try to keep at least one of an item in their inventory. They will not push the last of their item into an inventory even if they otherwise could. Active hoppers will not prevent other hoppers (active or otherwise) from taking their last item, though.|  Additionally, active hoppers won't do anything if they don't have at least one of an item in them.|  The last major difference is that active_hoppers can be placed on their sides as well. They can only move items from one side to the opposite one, however.|  Like regular hoppers, active hoppers can be disabled with a redstone signal.
research.item_duct.name=Item Ducts
research.item_duct.desc=Basic Item Flow
research.item_duct.info=  You've finally had enough. Hoppers are not cheap, and creating large trains of them is certainly a waste of space.|  To remedy this, you've created magic item ducting! These blocks are hollow in the inside and allow items to move through them. With a little bit of magic, you've also made them basically frictionless. Items can even flow up!|  Item ducts, when filled with items, carry the items forward. Ducts do not automatically pull out of inventories but will push items into inventories they are connected to.|  When items enter the duct, their direction is kept. When coming to an intersection, items will attempt to move forward in same direction they entered from. If that's impossible, the direction they move (besides backwards) is random.|  If items reach ducts that aren't connected to containers (or from a direction with no exit) the item will pop out of the duct onto the ground.
research.magicfacade.name=Magic Facade
research.magicfacade.desc=Fake walls
research.magicfacade.info=  A very simple and practical application of magic is that of an illusion. To that end, you've invented a ritual which allows you to create illusory blocks!|  Magic Facade clocks take the appearance of blocks next to them, but only in one direction. However, the facade blocks are completely intangeable.|  You've also extended this idea to create a one-way door. Like the facade, it's invisible and intangeable from all sides but one. From that side, these magic doors prevent entry.|  Most orientations of facade and door blocks take their appearance from the block underneath them. Stacking facades or doors works, too. Facades or doors that are facing down look to the east.
research.essence_seeds.name=Essence Seeds
research.essence_seeds.desc=Renewable Essence
research.essence_seeds.info=  In a feat of magic and inginuity, you've created seeds that store the power of magical essences.|  These seeds, once matured, will drop random magical essences.
research.dragon_armor.name=Dragon Armor
research.dragon_armor.desc=Protecting your new partner
research.dragon_armor.info=  Dragons have natural armor from their thick dragon hide. However, a few trips into the nether with your companion was all it took to realize some extra padding wouldn't hurt.|  Dragon armor can be equipped on a dragon in the inventory tab, assuming you've gained enough dragon bond to access it. Dragons can wear body armor as well as helmets.

research.wispblock.name=Wisp Summoning
research.wispblock.desc=Wispful thinking?
research.wispblock.info=  You've seen wisps floating along the night sky, and you've even seen them fight. They obviously have some affinity to magic and can cast spells. And they appear to have the same enemies as you. So... why not work together?|  You've created a block that allows you to summon wisps to fill the air, dance around, and (most importantly) kill mobs. The wisp block requires Aether to function, some extra reagents to burn, and a scroll, but will slowly spawn wisps that cast the spell in the scroll.
research.aether_cloaks.name=Aether Cloaks
research.aether_cloaks.desc=Functional & Fashionable!
research.aether_cloaks.info=  Aether Gems are handy for taking aether with you, but they have very limited capacity. You tried fashioning earings and rings out of the aether gems to get even a little more aether capacity, but couldn't get any of it to work.|  Imbueing cloth with the properties of aether, however, has shown to be incredible fruitful!|  The Aether Cloak allows you to store a LOT of aether. While you're wearing it, the cloak will automatically provide aether for any items you have that take aether.|  Quite mysteriously, the cloak seems to grow in capacity the more you use it, as well!|  You also think you can enhance the cloak to provide the aether in a more efficient manner, allowing you to draw upon the aether directly to cast spells!||  Aether cloaks support many different display options as well. Have wings and want to see them through the cape? Cut a hole in it! Cloak too big? Chop some of it off! Want a red cloak? Dye it!
research.aether_infusers.name=Aether Infusers
research.aether_infusers.desc=Aether Tools
research.aether_infusers.info=  Aether Infusers by themselves take a lot of aether and store them, creating a pure bubble of aether for quick charging players' inventories or items on altars above the infuser.|  If there's an altar above the Aether Infuser, all aether from the infuser will go to any item on the altar. For things that store Aether, this means they'll get charged quickly.|  If no altar is above the infuser, any players that step into the aether bubble will have all items in their inventory charged.||  Aether Infusers that have altars above them can also use Lenses to change their behavior. From growing nearby plants to granting swiftness, different lenses have different effects.|  Note that Master Lenses have to be placed on an altar above an Aether Infuser to work.|  Also note the Spread Lens allows nearby altars with lenses on them to work!
