    "info.spells.desc": "Spells are made up of shapes and effects. Shapes contain the main logic of a spell. For example: the touch shape specifies that the shape will affect the entity you're touching when you cast it; The health shape sets off the spell once the target's health drops below a certain threshhold; The proximity shape advances the spell once someone gets close enough to the spot it was placed. Spell effects contain the actual effects of the spell, from doing elemental damage to causing debuffs to transforming items into others. Spells can have multiple shapes in them, possible creating spells with multiple stages. If you have a spell that has a touch shape followed by a delay shape, the spell will start when cast by affecting whoever you were touching at the time. After that, any effects that directly follow the touch will be done, and then it will wait for the duration of the delay trigger. At that point the spell will proceed, performing any following shapes and effects until it ends. Constructing staged spells like this is a powerful component of Nostrum Magica, and allows you to create contingencies, delayed surprise attacks, and complex buff stacks.|The actual effect of a spell comes from the particular combination of elements and alterations. Any spell with only an element attached to it will do damage in that element. Alterations mutate the effects into others. For example, a spell segment with the physical element and the inflict alteration will reduce give weakness to the target. An effect with lightning and the support element will pull any nearby entities closer.

To add effects to a spell, you need to combine element and alteration runes with shapes runes to form filled shape runes. This is done simply by combining them in a crafting bench. Shape runes are loaded with some number of elements as well as optionally a single alteration. This combination (the number of elements and the alteration that's attached, if any) determine the actaul effect of the shape. You can have multiple shapes in a spell. Each will be performed on the target of the spell at that time. A more in-depth guide to creating filled shape runes can be found in the Spellcraft guide.|Shape shrines are much rarer than trigger and element shrines.

To get a level three, you'll need the equivalent of 4 level 1 runes.|As part of unlocking magic, you automatically gain first level mastery over the Physical element. In order to master the other elements, you must form mastery orbs and offere them to shrines of those elements. After doing so, you will begin the challenge for that element. Each is different and requires you to be come further attuned to that element. You can master an element up to three times. Gaining mastery one over an element allows you to craft runes of that element. Gaining further mastery allows you to power shape runes up with the same element further.

These loaded shape runes are then placed along with trigger runes on a spell table to specify the effects and logic of the spell.|Spells always begin with a trigger. After the first trigger, there are some number of loaded shapes and triggers that follow. Spells follow a strict sequence of effects and stages defined by the sequence of triggers and shapes used to create the spell. A spell that starts with a self trigger followed by a delay trigger and then some shape will always first apply to the caster, wait some length of time defined by the delay trigger, and then apply the effects to the target (the caster). Some triggers may affect multiple players or mobs, in which case all parts of the spell that come after are applied to each player or mob affect. Building off the previous example, a spell that starts with a beam trigger that's followed by a delay trigger and then some effect will fire a beam from the caster. Each player or mob hit by the beam will then, after some delay, have the effects that follow the delay trigger applied to them.|To actually begin crafting a spell, you'll need to get runes. The easiest way to get runes is to find them as loot in dungeons. Runes are most readily found in shrines, but can found in most other dungeons as well. The most efficient way of gettings runes, however, is to craft them. In order to craft runes, you'll need to have already mastered that type of rune. For example, you must have already visited a shrine to a Trigger and gained mastery before you can perform the ritual to craft it.|Trigger runes are used as-is. Shapes must be combined with elements and alterations before they can be used in a spell.|Creating spells on a spell table also requires the reagents the spell will cost to cast.

While you have mana armor active, you will have reduced maximum mana to use. This maximum mana is returned to you once your mana armor is exhausted and fades.|  While you have mana armor activated, damage from most damage types will be negated. Some damage types will not be impacted and may kill you, including fall damage and falling out of the world.|  Your mana armor will stay activated until you run out of mana or die from damage that goes through your armor. Once it has been broken, you'll have to use a mana armorer again to activate it once more.|  Because mana armor covers your body and not your armor, your armor impacts how much damage the mana armor has to negate. Your armor will still lose durability. Additionally, effects that give you extra health pools (like Absorption) will not be covered by mana armor.",
